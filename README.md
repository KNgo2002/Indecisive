## About The Project 
For this project, I took on the challenge of coding with a new framework, resulting in the creation of "Indecisive"—an iOS app designed for those moments of indecision, whether it's choosing where to eat or picking an outfit. Having relied on online randomizers in the past, I recognized the need for a consolidated decision-making tool, sparking the idea for "Indecisive." In the span of 8 days, I deepened my understanding of iOS development by personally crafting visual assets and exploring app structures. Despite its simplicity, the development of "Indecisive" brought forth unique challenges that enriched my knowledge and skills in app development
